# Description :
    A cubemap is a collection of six square images that represent the reflections of an environment. 
    The six images are arranged to form the faces of an imaginary cube that surrounds an object. 
    The cubemap's effect is to create the illusion that the observer is surrounded by the scene that was used to generate the cubemap.
