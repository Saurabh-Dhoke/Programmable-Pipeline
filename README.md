# Programmable-Pipeline

# Summary : 
    This repository Programmable-Pipeline  is a collection of projects demonstrating various
    graphics programming techniques,using the OpenGL programmable pipeline. 
    Each project showcases a specific graphical effect or rendering technique implemented through shaders and OpenGL.​

Here's an overview of the projects included in the repository:

# Solar System:
    Simulates a solar system, likely featuring planets orbiting a star. 
    This project demonstrates hierarchical modeling and transformations in OpenGL to represent celestial movements.​

# CubeMap Effect:
    Implements environment mapping using cube maps. This technique is commonly used 
    to create reflective surfaces by mapping six textures onto the inner sides of a cube, 
    simulating reflections based on the environment.​

# Desaturation Effect:
    Applies a desaturation shader to render scenes in grayscale. 
    This effect is useful for achieving stylistic visuals or simulating color blindness in applications.​

# Vignette Effect:
    Adds a vignette effect, darkening the corners of the rendered image to draw attention to the center. 
    This is often used in photography and cinematography to create a focal point.​

# Sepia Effect:
    Applies a sepia-tone filter to the scene, giving it a warm, brownish tint reminiscent of old photographs.
    This effect is achieved through fragment shaders that adjust the color balance of the rendered image.​

# Julia Fractals Set:
    Renders Julia fractals, which are complex and self-similar mathematical shapes. 
    This project likely utilizes iterative algorithms within fragment shaders to compute and display these intricate patterns.​

# 3D Noise:
    Generates 3D noise textures, useful for creating natural-looking textures like marble, 
    clouds, or terrain. This project demonstrates procedural texture generation techniques using shaders.​


  The repository primarily contains source code written in C++ and C, with a focus on
leveraging OpenGL's capabilities to create these effects. Each project serves as a 
practical example of how to implement specific graphical techniques using the programmable pipeline in OpenGL.​
