# Description : 
    The Julia Set Fractal is a type of fractal defined by the behavior of a function that operates on input complex numbers. 
            A Fractal is a type of mathematical shape that are infinitely complex. In essence, a Fractal is a pattern that repeats forever, and every part of the Fractal, regardless of how zoomed in, or zoomed out you are, it looks very similar to the whole image.
